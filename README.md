# # Stori-QA-Automation-Challenge
---
The following guide, demonstrate and explains how to run successfully my soluction based on JavaScript, NodeJS and cypress.
The why I've chosen this stack of tech, the challenge is based on a web view and cypress is the trending topic and the best and simpliest tool right now.

## Fist Step
Go to github and download the repo and open with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or any IDE of your preference.

## Installation

This challenges needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run and [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/).
Verify that node and npm is installed on your machine
```sh
node --version && npm --version
v16.17.0
8.15.0
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```
